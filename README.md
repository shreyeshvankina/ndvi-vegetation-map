## Satellite NDVI Vegetation Analysis/Map – Hawaii

**Objective**  
Measure vegetation health using satellite imagery and NDVI.

**Motivation**  
I chose Hawaii as the study region because to its unique rain geography. Due to it's big volcanic mountains blocking moist winds hitting from the northeast, Hawaii's islands experience a heavy rainfall enviornment on one side of the islands while almost a dry desert on the other. This creates strong vegetation contrasts within a small geographic area.

**Data**  
Landsat 8 Level-2 Surface Reflectance (Red & NIR bands).

**Methods**  
- Raster data processing
- NDVI computation
- Vegetation patterns were visualized
- Summarize using Basic statistical analysis

**Results**  
The NDVI map shows higher vegetation density on the windward sides of the islands and lower NDVI values along coastal and leeward regions. While Hawaii is often viewed as a lush environment, much of the land shows NDVI values that are closer to sparse or moderate vegetation classification. This shows the presence of rocky terrain, dry regions, and recent problems such as climate change, droughts, and invasive species.
